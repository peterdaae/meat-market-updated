Feedback I have been provided :

What is good about the solution?

    1. Correct indentation use
    2. Good coding structure
    3. Good and understandable use of fontawesome
    4. Global css used for both pages
    5. Good function having a total amount and the elements of the cart not repeating themselves.
    6. importing functions only from module is good

What can be improved about the solution?

    1. Variable names can be a bit confusing, displayOutput/displayProducts for example
    2. Poor lack of separation between HTML elements and JS created HTML elements
    3. Styling might need a bit more thought
    4. Semicolons are used variably
    5. More "space" between name, price and button purchase product
    6. Product boxes issue, purchase button outside of box should be fixed

    1. Good use of IIFE function
    2. Semantic use HTML
    3. Code structure is well done
    4. Creative design 


What can be improved about the solution?

    1. Function names and variable names doesn´t make much sense
    2. Shopping cart doesn´t show total amount
    3. Localstorage amount doesn´t add the product but adds another product with amount 1, needs to be fixed
    4. Having one css for both pages makes code not very readable
