What can be improved about the solution?

    1. Variable names can be a bit confusing, displayOutput/displayProducts for example
    2. Poor lack of separation between HTML elements and JS created HTML elements
    3. Styling might need a bit more thought
    4. Semicolons are used variably
    5. Mer "space" mellom navn og pris/kj√∏p
